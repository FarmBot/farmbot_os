      * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
        on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
        coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
        isn't necessary.
      * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
        standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
        upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
      * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
        upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
        longer need to finalize the upgrade. If not, there's no change.
